# West library branch
A long halway makes up the western portion of the library. Along the walls, more wooden bookshelves line the walls. Unlike the central chamber, each book is neatly and orderly fit in with one another. There are no loose papers slipped inbetween or books stacked haphazardly on one another.

The immaculate shelves follow the hallway to a crossroads, where the hallway branches into multiple paths, each with there own bookshelves and volumes of knowledge lining the path deeper into the western branch. 

There are two exits,
    the [void library]
    the [void west-library-heart]
