# Library in the void
Wooden bookshelves line the circular walls, with countless books spilling out of the shelves. Loose pieces of paper lay scattered across the floor and tucked in between spines. Ink pots, pens, and other writing supplies are scattered across the tables standing in the center of the room.

A few of the nameless can be seen walking throughout the library. Browsing the titles on the shelves, or studying texts at the tables. 

There are three exits, 
    the [void west-library]
    the [void east-library]
    the [void town square]
