        2. a mind altering substance or food. The initial effects vary from subject to subject, but will eventually cause the participant to black out within 3 minutes. After which the subject will wake up in a stone chamber with exactly one exit.
        3. an intricately drawn spell circle and ritual combination that transports humanoid entities within its activation rings to seperate stone chambers with exactly one exit.
